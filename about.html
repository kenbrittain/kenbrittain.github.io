<h1>About</h1>
<p class="text-muted">"Ken Brittain" &lt;kenneth.brittain@gmail.com&gt;</p>

<p>
    This blog is the place where I record things that are of interest to me and me alone. If
    you find them useful congratulations. If you do not then it is called the World Wide Web
    for a reason. I do nothing magical
</p>
<p>
    I have been a developer for quite some time now. I have worked on many different things
    from embedded systems to large scale J2EE systems.
</p>
<p>
    I do not really so social media. So there is no Instagram, Snap, or likewise. I had a Twitter
    handle once but that turned out to be a useful. You can find any work public work on
    my <a href="https://github.com/kenbrittain">GitHub</a> and professional experience
    on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ken-brittain">LinkedIn</a>.
