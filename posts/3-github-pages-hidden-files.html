<h1>GitHub Pages Hidden Files</h1>
<p>9/28/2021</p>

<p>
    Thig blog is a static HTML website. That means the files contained within it are 
    kept rather lean. Everything is either copies or written by hand so keeping
    the non-blog contents to a minimum is a plus. To that end, I create two (2) files
    that can be used as templates for posts. I placed them in a directory called
    <code>.templates</code> (super creative I know).
</p>
<p>
    Next, I checked the website because I wanted to see how these files were served.
    It turns out that they weren't served at all. I <i>discovered</i> that GitHub 
    Pages hides files and directories that begin with the underscore <code>_</code> 
    and dot <code>.</code> characters.
</p>

<p>
    I was pretty sure that I was not the only person who <i>discovered</i> this tidbit. With just
    a bit of searching I found the reason why these files are hidden. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
    processes your repository using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll
    hides these prefixed files and directories because are the are special to that tool.
</p>

<p>
    To serve or not to serve? I decided to serve my newly minted template files by using
    inserting the <code>.nojekyll</code> file and having my static website be, well, static.
    I am sure that in some fashion pushes will be processed faster. 
</p>

<p>
    The offical announcement of the feature was made in 2009 on *The GitHub 
    Blog* - <a href="https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/">Bypassing Jekyll on GitHub Pages</a>.

    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> had the following answers which tipped me off in the first place:
