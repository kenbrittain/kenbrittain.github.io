<h1>Keep it Simple Stupid</h1>
<p class="text-muted">9/12/2021</p>

<p>
    The time has come to launch a blog. There are companies being funded that
    solely provide blogging tools for <a href="https://hashnode.com">developers</a>. I went through
    the usual developer conundrum of "do I wrote another blogging tool?"
</p>

<p>
    This blog is a static HTML web site. It is simple. It is very simple. There is little beyond a single CSS
    file to keep thing in order. I write in HTML as well. Markdown is great for what it is but there
    very little keeping it from being HTML. Creating tables in markdown means you might as well be using
    HTML anyway. Do I plan on using a lot of tables? Who knows, I just started.
</p>

<p>
    There is no blog generator. This is just a website where I record things. It may be a complete mistake
    and I reserve the right to change in the future (but you knew that anyway).
</p>

<p>
    What about your favicon? Nope ... don't really care.
</p>

<p>
    I use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> because it handles a lot things for me. It provides
    a decent cross-browser look and feel.
