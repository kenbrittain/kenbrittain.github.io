<h1>Keep it Simple Stupid</h1>
<p>9/14/2021 (edited: 9/22/2021)</p>

<p>
    There are companies being funded that solely provide blogging tools for 
    developers: <a href="https://hashnode.com">Hashnode</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a>. 
    So why not just use that? Well, I went through the usual developer range of solutions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Duh ... Wordpress?</li>
    <li>Do I write my own blog engine?</li>
    <li>Should I use a static site generator?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Something inside of me did not want to use <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.
</p>

<p>
    While tempting, writing yet another blog engine would be easy, but not too fun. Once started
    I am sure it would require, yet another feature to be just right. The next thing you know I 
    am maintaining a blog engine. A blog engine with a single user. Scratching your own is fine
    but that itch has been scratched so many time befores by so many <a href="https://github.com/topics/blog-engine?l=c%23">others</a>.
</p>

    I have used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> in the past. It is powerful yet simple to use and 
    I had a 100% horrible time installing it on <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>. I finally
    wound up up just running from a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
    <a href="https://ddewaele.github.io/running-jekyll-in-docker/">container</a>. What to do?
</p>

<p>
    This blog is a static HTML web site. It is simple. It is very simple. There is 
    little beyond a single CSS file to keep things in order. I write in HTML as well.
    <a href="https://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a> is great for what it is but there 
    very little keeping it from being HTML. Creating tables in markdown means you 
    might as well be using HTML anyway. Do I plan on using a lot of tables? Who knows, I just started.
</p>

<p>
    What about your favicon? Nope ... don't really care.
</p>

    I made a concession to use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> because it 
    handles a lot things for me. It provides a decent cross-browser look and feel. That is definetely
    something I did not want to fuss with.
  </strike>

<p>
  Found and changed styles to use
  the <a href="https://sukima.github.io/hackcss-ext/">hack.css</a>
  stylesheet as it is lighter
  than <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and handles
  mobile nicely.
