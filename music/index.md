Since the pandemic started I found myself listening to the same music over and over. It was familiar and relaxing. I had cleared out my library, playlists, and listened to the same music for pretty much all of 2020. Due to the pandemic I was lucky enough to be able to work from home. I built a makeshift office in the basement and put the music on repeat.

First it was [Peter Gabriel](petergabriel.html) but when [Fish](fish.html) released his final album I switched. I have listened to his music since I was teenager. This was the closing of era. I cleared out Peter Gabriel and downloaded all the [Fish](fish.html) [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) could muster. Then it happened...

After a year and a half of [Fish](fish.html) my family asked me to take a break. They were sick of hearing it. They wanted something different ... so we made it into a game.

Every quarter they get to pick an artist and I listen to that artist ... exclusively. That is the word that I have used but let's be honest, Fish and PG slip back in periodically. My goal is to broaden my musical horizons by going deep. I feel if you listen to an artist, intensely, research the albums, and their life, after a time you get a fuller appreciation of their work.

I will always *appreciate* Fish but will be expanding that box. I'm sure he would approve.
