This is the music that I listened to after Fish announced his final
album. I might get grief for including [Internal Exile][exile] and
[Suits][suits] so high in this list but I cannot get those out of my
rotation. I have included some of the Marillion because, let's face
it, he was voice of that band, but his solo music shines.
