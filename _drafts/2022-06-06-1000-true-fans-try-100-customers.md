title: 1,000 True Fans? Try 100 Customers
layout: post

It is possible to have a profitable business with only 100 customers.

If you accept only 100 customers, then the only variable to your revenue will be how much you charge.

In the blog post [1,000 True Fans? Try 100](post) by [Li Jin](author) the argument is made that the adage 1,000 True Fans can be replaced by fewer fans, let's say 100, if the revenue per fan is higher.

## Fans can be customers

Fans are people that spend money on your content. Your content can be creative content. I believe that content can also be software. It is still digital. If it solves a problem then you will find fans. That is why I am building in public.

The next step will be to convert the fans into customers.

## You only need 100 true customers

Assign each customer a bugdet of $1,000 per year. If the software you are selling solves a business problem then corporations will be interested. If the software can give them a savings of more than $1,000, by either solving a problem, or freeing up more time, then corporations will but the software.

This price point is expensive for individuals.
