* Story about "Ken doesn't read commit" messages
* Subject -  Length 52
* Body - Length 72
* Tell me why not how.

I had been my experience that there are three (3) types of developers on the commit message spectrum. This post some of the rules why commit messages are needed and why I am in the third category of developers. 

* Consistent Commit Message Writers
* Maliciously Compliant Commit Message Writers
* Reformed (or Learning) Commit Message Writers

## Good Committers

The first group of developers are the individuals you want to work and they write good commit messages. This includes anyone who tries to write good message and are learning suc as new developers or reformed teammates. The messages are generally helpful, they let us know why a change was made, and their commits are easily scannable for a change. 

## Bad Committers
 
The next group are those that write commit messages but are only doing so to comply with the standard or team rule that states all commits will have *commit message*. These folks are generally up to no good and (maliciously compliant)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance].
