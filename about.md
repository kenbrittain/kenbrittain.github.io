"Ken Brittain" &lt;kenneth.brittain@gmail.com&gt;

This blog is the place where I record things that are of interest to me and me
alone. If you find them useful congratulations there is no charge. 

I have been a developer for quite some time now. I have worked on many things
from [embedded][1] systems to large scale [J2EE][2]. I enjoy writing code. 
I am
currently obsessing over runbooks for some reason. I think they should be
automated, executable, and available. They are usually neglected.

I do not really do much social media. There is no Instagram, Snap, Facebook, or
others, but I do have a [Twitter][3] handle. You can find any public work on
my <a href="https://github.com/kenbrittain">GitHub</a> and professional
experience on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ken-brittain">LinkedIn</a>.
