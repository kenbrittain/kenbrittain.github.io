title: Phases of DevOps Adoption
---

<p>
    In my tenure supporting software teams and implementing DevOps, I have come to
    accept the following phases of adoption. This means that starting with a
    development team performing legacy development and deployment there is an
    adoption process they must go through. DevOps can be mandated and they can
    be told about CALMS, etc. but nothing will change until they proceed through
    these phases. Some organizations can go faster and some will go slower. If
    you do not allow them to progress you will probably just get malicious
    compliance. If you are looking for a change then allow the following phases to
    develop naturally. Trust me, I've fought the battle and teams will not change
    unless they want to. Let them.
</p>

<h2>Phases of DevOps Adoption </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Automate the Manual</li>
    <li>Make it Better</li>
    <li>Optimize for DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>
    It all starts with the decision to begin a DevOps transformation. When most
    companies begin implementing DevOps it boils down to creating a culture
    where development teams are accountable. They are accountable for building
    their projects, deploying them, and supporting them. This is difficult
    because, historically, they may not have been the case. They may have been
    part of a culture that created a ticket and requested files to be copied to
    a server. This may seem very old school, but trust me, there are many
    companies still performing software deploys this way. I'm sure yours is not
    one of them ;)
</p>

<h2>Automate the Manual</h2>

<p>
    There are two (2) things that need to be automated. First, nothing else
    can proceed until you have a repeatable build process that is not located
    on the developers' machine. Next, you need the ability to consistently
    deploy the product to an initial environment or location. Scripts are
    preferable but documentation can suffice at the start.
</p>

<p>
    The first goal is to get the build off the desktop. If the development team
    gives you a binary from their machine: STOP! At the very least you can script
    a simple build process and locate that on a server. Work with the team to
    document the build process and get it off the desktop! I cannot reiterate
    that enough.
</p>

<p>
    Automating the build process is generally started by creating a build job
    in a build system. This step has traditionally been implemented in Jenkins,
    as it is available for free, and easily installed, but I have also used
    PowerShell and SSH to kick off the build. Remember, the goal is to get the
    build process off of the developers' machine. At this point, we are not
    concerned with pipelines. The only pipeline you should care about is building
    the project.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Now, some of you will be raising your eyebrows and questioning my
    trustworthiness for claiming development teams are building on a desktop and
    copying files to a server. The year is 2021 and containers rule the world.
    Kubernetes! Cloud! Trust me, they exist, and they are in your company.
    You just have not found them yet.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The next step is defining the deployment process. If the team does not have
    a document or artifact that describes the deployment process then I would
    guess they do not know the dependencies for their project. This has
    played out multiple times with statements like "the deployment process is
    easy ... just copy these files to this directory on the server." What about
    database credentials and configurations? Are there any local directories that
    need to exist for logging? Where does the files configuration go? Who has
    access to the passwords and how do they get changed when security rotates
    them for you?
</p>

<p>
    Define the deployment process and make sure it includes dependencies. This
    part of the exercise can be done in Confluence or held in a Word document.
    It doesn't matter where but it needs to be done. You cannot automate anything
    unless you know what you are trying to automate. Anyone who tells you that
    their deployment process is simply copying files is lying.
</p>

<h2>Make it Better</h2>

<p>
    When you begin the process of automation there may be mistrust for the
    implementation. You will need to answer questions like:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>How do I know the correct files were copied to that directory?</li>
    <li>Why would deploy a file that has not changed?</li>
    <li>How can I review the artifacts created in the build to make sure they are correct?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    During this phase, the development team may be questioning the process but
    are generally pleased with the results. That is, they now have more time on
    their hands because the manual stuff, or at least a good portion of it,
    has been automated.
</p>

<p>
    The questions above are real questions from real development teams. Please
    remember that a team cranking out business requests to a batch process that
    has worked for over 10+ years will question things. They will not have the
    level of comfort that you do with an automated process. The goal of this
    phase is to give that team the same level of comfort.
</p>

<p>
    Making it better means using the various tools to provide insight into the
    processes you are automating. If you are creating a zip file with the
    binaries from a build we have done the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Display the version of a DLL (for Windows) or file in the log before packaging.</li>
    <li>Calculate and display an MD5 checksum for each file.</li>
    <li>Create a manifest file with the contents of what you are packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Remember, the team may be apprehensive about the automation being thrust
    upon them. From the simplest form of scripting the build and packaging process
    and placing the result on a file server to a full-blown Jenkins pipeline with
    the artifacts ending up in a binary repository. They may want it, like it,
    or trust it. It is different from what they have done, or have been doing,
    for years! You need to show them and demonstrate via the tooling that the
    process is better than the way they were doing it originally.
</p>

<p>
    You will know this phase is over when the development teams begin to trust
    the build and deploy process. This will be apparent when they 1) don't talk
    or ask questions about it how it works anymore, and 2) they begin requesting
    features.
</p>

<h2>Optimize for DevOps</h2>

<p>
    At this point, you have development team that is comfortable with the
    automation. The deployment process went from some level of documentation to,
    perhaps, a full deployment process in a vendor product. More than likely you
    will have a Jenkins server being pushed to its limits.
</p>

<p>
    These are good things. Any automation, even the simplest, is better than
    a non-repeatable process being executed on some random developer's
    desktop. The worst way to find out about that build process is when they
    leave the company and things stop.
</p>

<p>
    This phase goes on pretty much forever. There will be migrations from tool
    "A" to tool "B" coming along based upon the company's appetite for change
    and cost. Product versions and operating system updates will be installed.
    Most importantly, the development teams will be being requesting things
    along the lines of:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Can we run these integration tests after we deploy ... automatically?</li>
    <li>I want to build the branch first and if the unit tests pass then I want to merge.</li>
    <li>Can I deploy all of my projects to a single environment ... at once?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When there is trust in the system developed or utilized there is no telling
    how far or fast the teams can go. You must give a traditional, or legacy
    process-focused team time to adjust. I have never encountered a development
    team that questions automation after they have gone through these phases.
    For the record, starting in the first phase and proceeding through until the
    last, in my experience, takes two (2) years. Mind you this was without any
    management mandate and we modernized and automated thousands of projects
    across roughly two (2) dozen development teams.
