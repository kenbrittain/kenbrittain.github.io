## Many software companies are a joke

The title of the [Medium][medium] post was obviously provocative. The author wanted me to click. So I clicked and read [Many software companies are a joke][post] today. 

The initial read it paints a bleak picture of corporate software development. I get that this post is a rant. I was surprised by the author having worked two (2) decades as a software developers. This was not the disillusioned ramblings of a junior developer lamenting the death of their dreams. This was an individual with some development chops.

The following quote sums up the entire article pretty well:

> One thing I can tell you is that a lot of “software engineers” especially the ones working in really big companies do very little work.

It sounded like the author participated in, and withstood a lot of nonsense. I was not there but I can pretend. Preparing for and attending meetings with slides and spreadsheets is something that is done all of the time. Only getting 1-2 hours of coding done per day? I am not going to argue with the numbers. I will argue that the author's expectations were wrong and that affected his entire world.

You see, he did not work for a software company.

## Software companies sell software

The author of the post, [Lou Liou][profile], worked for a *large financial institution*. This is a big item on level setting the expectations for a software developer. If the product or service that is being sold is not software, or even technology, then you work for a regular company. Regular companies use software. Regular companies may even develop custom software. But a regular company is not a software company.

At regular companies the IT department is a cost center. IT supports the creation and sale the product or service but it is not the product or service. Having worked for both software companies and contracted with and for insurance companies I can assure you they are two (2) different animals. When the product or service is not software or a technology the company revolves around a different axis. The business side of the house runs the house. IT and software developers, while required, react to the business.

Do not get me wrong, some companies have great IT departments and they work very well with the business but they are not the business. Working as a software developer in this type of company makes you more of a resource than a developer. When you are a software developer, in a 4 person startup creating something exciting, you *are* the business. 

Trust me it is different.

## Revenue increases the time required develop any solution

I am not talking about *potential* revenue here, like in a small startup scenario. I am talking about the recurring revenue that large financial institutions have, and rely upon, to pay their employees. Insurance is a regulated environment and I have been told that the financial segment is regulated even more so. That means most of what is developed is going to take too long. The overriding goal is to protect the company from losing revenue due to wrong decisions being made.

When I worked at the large regional insurance provider there were a lot more roadblocks, meetings, and key go/no-go checks for ... well, basically everything. That company was purchased by a national provider. While the original company's revenue was still about the same, the parent organization's revenue was an order of magnitude larger. The frameworks in place to protect them were, well, an order of magnitude larger.

I had come from a medium side software company. Moving into this corporate slot was a decision that I made on purpose. My goals was to learn, document, and make better the DevOps capability of a company that had no DevOps footprint, mindset, or practice. I knew what to expect and it still bothered me at times.

## Being busy versus being productive

The author sates that *we were always busy but seldom productive.* Productive in the eyes of a software developer is time spent writing code. Time spent coding is crucial to job satisfaction. If you are not spending the bulk of your time coding then you are probably not a software developer. 

Larger companies tend to have many layers. The layers for a developer start with the lowest rung of a ladder called junior developer, then continues to senior, and then rises into the lead, staff, and principal developer/engineering roles. Each company can have different names but the roles are generally there. As you progress you are doing less coding. At the lead level you still write code but are more focused on delivering the solution. This entails many different things to each company but it definitely entails writing a lot less code.

Are you being productive? The junior developer will be writing a lot of code. That is pretty much all they are allowed to do. That is productive. A senior developer and above the added responsibilities start taking a bite out of coding time. Leads have a project to run and deliver. Yes there is coding but it is different than heads down programming all day, every day. There are more project related tasks that need to be accomplished. For starters, you need to work on keeping the rest of the team moving forward. That is not exactly writing code but it enabling other to write code to deliver the solution.

## Team size does not matter

The author writes that working in a small company, writing C++ for *really complex post-processing effects* and *learning, exploring and discovery* every day, where he found fulfillment. It sounds like the Leo just really likes working on small teams where the politics is limited and management is more direct. The team at the VFX company was small and appeared to be self directed. It sounds like that is the sweet spot for this individual.

I work on a small team. We are pretty self directed as well. We still have to deal with what I call the big company issues. As a lead I try to deflect that from the rest of the team to keep them developing and writing code. It is not always possible so I get missing the days of writing code. That is what side projects are for!

## Conclusion

I appreciate the time it took Leo Liou to write the post. It does sound like the company where he worked did not have a desirable working environment. Working in a big company takes a certain mindset. Things do move a lot slower due to the nature and size of the job. There is either a process for everything or you need to create that process.  Doing corporate software development is more about communication than writing software.

Although writing code is still part of the job it is not the whole job.
