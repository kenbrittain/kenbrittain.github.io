title: "TAOCP: Volume 1, Chapter 1 - Basic Concepts, 1.2 Mathematical Induction"
layout: taocp
tag: taocp
summary: |
  Section 1.2.1 defines mathematical induction by contrasting it to inductive reasoning and 
  by providing examples    of both.
takeaway: |
  Mathematical induction is different from inductive reasoning. Basically, you can prove that
  a procedure is true, make an assumption about the rest of the outputs, and then prove that
  assumption.

Mathematical induction is concept for proving that if a procedure, or equation, *P(n)* is true for *all positive integers n*, you can prove that *P(1)* is true, and also that *P(n+1)* is true. The *P(n+1)* part if the induction. It is something that you believe to be true. It is something that you worked out long hand and found to be reasonable true.

Knuth writes a very large proof for the previously presented Algorithm E (Extended Euclid's algorithm). This one is nuts and I followed none of it. This goes on for 2 pages.

There was so much math.  Knuth offers a way out for the sake of *motivation* allowing the reader to skim this chapter. After studying for 2 hours, and re-reading many times, I still could not understand the math. I get the induction part, which is what I think the purpose of the section truly is.

I took the out and accepted the skim.

## Exercises

I remember being in college and taking a final exam where I could not even understand the questions. Oddly enough this was for a course in my field of study.

There were 15 exercises in this section. The most difficult being a level HM28. I felt like I was sitting in that lecture hall again reading and rereading that test. I was looking for an out and did not have one. Thankfully Knuth gave me one. No exercises were completed.
