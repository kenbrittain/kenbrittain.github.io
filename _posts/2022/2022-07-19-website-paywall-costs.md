title: Content Costs Money and This is How Much I Would Have Paid to View it All Last Month

Have you ever clicked on a link and were presented with a paywalled article?

Sure you have. This is the 2022 web. Publications want your dollars. After 
running into a few too many requests I spent a month tracking requests
for paywalled content. 

If I had payed for the access it would have came out to over $1,000 per year
for all of the requested subscriptions. I was not going to do that. I am not 
a journalist, pundit, or even somebody who write about the news. I have no
need to be that up-to-date online.

I would like to say that I have a rule to respect copyright and pay for all 
of my software, movies, and digital content. I have no issues with 
publications putting content behind a paywall. I just got tired of being asked.

Here is the list of websites.

| Website                                 | Period | Cost   | Total Cost |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----: | -----: | ---------: |
| [Bloomberg][bloomberg]                  | M      | $1.99  | $23.88     |
| [Daily Gazette][gazette]                | A      | $145   | $145       |
| [The Economist][economist]              | A      | $189   | $189       |
| [The Financial Times][ft]               | M/A    | $40    | $186*      |
| [Insider][insider]                      | A      | $49    | $49^       |
| [The New York Times][nyt]               | W      | $1     | $52        |
| [Silicon Valley Business Journal][svbj] | M      | $4     | $48        |
| [The Telegraph (UK)][telegraph]         | M      | $0.50? | $12.99     |
| [The Times (UK)][timesuk]               | M      | $3/$5  | $57        |
| [The Washington Post][wapo]             | A      | $40    | $40        |
| [The Wall Street Journal][wsj]          | M      | $4     | $48        |
| [Wired][wired]                          | A      | $30    | $30        |

Noticably absent are [Reuters][reuters] and the [Associated Press][ap]. I am not sure
if they ever asked.

I tried to keep things straight but it did become confusing. There were special
offers and deals to be had. I am not sure if they are still running the bargains
nor do I really care. I was more interested in how much it would have cost if I
had pay the $ for a subscription. I could have saved half of my $ by choosing a
single month (some only offered annual).

This experiment was not scientific by any means. It was done in an adhoc manner because
I was tired of being asked for $. You mileage may vary.

\* The cost for the *The Financial Times* was quoted as $40 per month but they offered an annual subscription for $186.

^ The cost for *Insider* was a special price of $49 where normally the subscription would $99.
