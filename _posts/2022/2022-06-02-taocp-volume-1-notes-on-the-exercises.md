Starting *The Art of Computer Programming* and the exercises have a flow chart. There are 18 steps detailed in the text and it reads like a use case document. I have so many questions.

Step #2 says "Read the Notes on the Exercises" so I will be giving that a try. I am sure this has meaning. I am sure I need to read it. I am more concerned with the *Summary of Codes* used to describe the exercises themselves.

## Summary of Codes

The commentary in parentheses is mine.

* &gt;&gt; - Recommended
* M - Mathematically oriented
* HM - Requiring "higher math"
* 00 - Immediate
* 10 - Simple (one minute)
* 20 - Medium (quarter hour) 
* 30 - Moderately hard
* 40 - Term project *(I wonder how many of these types of questions will turn up?)*
* 50 - Research project *(Yeah, no thanks)*

## Exercises

Here are the questions for the *notes on exercises* section. If you can do the math have at it; otherwise there is Chapter One waiting.

1. [00] What does the rating "M20" mean?
2. [10] Of what value can the exercises in a textbook be to the reader?
3. [14] Prove that 13<sup>3</sup> = 2197. Generalize your answer. [This is an example of a horrible king of problem that the author has tried to avoid.]
4. [HM45] Prove that when *n* is an integer, *n > 2*, the equation x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> = z<sup>n</sup> has no solution in positive integers *x*, *y*, *z*.
