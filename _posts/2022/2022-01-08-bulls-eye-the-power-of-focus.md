This post is my notes from reading the book [Bull’s Eye: The Power of Focus]
[bullseye] by Brian Tracy. They had been sitting in my 3-ring binder for the
past seven years. This book has a lot in common with another Brian Tracy book
called [Goals!: How to Get Everything You Want -- Faster Than You Ever 
Thought Possible][goals].

_Goals!_ was published in 2010 and _Bull’s Eye_ in 2015. I read _Bull’s Eye_ 
first and while I liked _Goals!_ it covered the same territory. The author
might disagree, but my notes are the same.

I really do like reading Brian Tracy a lot. I have over seven of his books 
in my Kindle library and have given numerous copies of [Eat That Frog!: 21 
Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time][frog] 
away as gifts (and I use that work lightly). His books tend to repeat a lot of
his ideas, but sometimes it is good to be told the truth again.

## Clarity, Focus, and Concentration

1. **Set goals.** Decide exactly what you want and be specific.
2. **Write it down.** Make it measurable. Only 3 percent of adults have written 
   goals.
3. **Set a deadline.** Setting a deadline forces your subconscious mind to 
   “solve the problem” and accomplish the goal.
4. **Make a list.** Write down everything you will have to do to achieve your 
   goal.
5. **Organize the list into a plan.** Once you have a written list of 
   activities organized by sequence and priority, you have a plan to accomplish any goal you set for yourself.
6. **Take action on your list of activities.** The key to success has always 
   been to have courage, overcome inertia most people have, and simply take the first step.
   1. **Do something every day that moves you toward your most important 
      goal.** You start to move faster and faster toward your goal, and your 
      goal starts to move faster and faster toward you.

## The Three P Formula

1. Personal means that you use I and an action verb for each goal. For 
   example, you say “I earn…”, or “I achieve…” 
2. Write it in the positive tense. Instead of saying “I will quit smoking,” 
   you say, “I am a nonsmoker.” 
3. Write it in the present tense. Write your goal as though the time has 
   passed, and you have already achieved your goal. You are describing it as 
   though it is a current reality.

## Prioritize Your Plan

1. A = MUST DO
2. B = SHOULD DO
3. C = NICE TO DO
4. D = DELEGATE
5. E = ELIMINATE

## 7 Great Behaviors

1. Never criticize, condemn, or complain about people or their behaviors. 
2. Don’t generate a negative personality.
3. Be agreeable. If it’s not really important just let it go. Be cheerful, 
   open and friendly.
4. Practice acceptance. How do you practice acceptance? Simple – just smile.
5. Express appreciation. How do you express appreciation? Simple – just say 
   thank you.
6. Express admiration. Each time you compliment a person you make them feel 
   more valuable and important.
7. Express approval. Continually praise people when they do something right, 
   at the same time, refuse to criticize or complain when they make a mistake.
8. Pay attention. In effective listening, you should listen without 
   interrupting or making any attempt to interrupt.
