title: Parameter Null Checking is Gone Before it Even Arrived
layout: post
---

The *proposed* parameter null checking feature has been removed from C# 11. I never really had the feature so I am not going to miss it. I will miss the idea of having it. 

I was actually looking forward to a day when the parameter syntax `!!` would handle null checks. It seems that the feature was removed after/during the [C# Language Design Meeting for April 13th, 2022][ldm]. 

My argument for this feature was pure and simple: I did not want to write code to check for null all of time. Sorry but I am a lazy developer.	

My point, in my [last post][post], on the *proposed* feature was that Microsoft was designing the C# language for developers to get things done. That still is true, even if this feature was eventually pulled from the next release.

It was gone before it even arrived.
