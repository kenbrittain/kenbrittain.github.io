title: Making Runbooks Available

Your runbooks need to exist outside your normal everyday systems. It is fine to
put then into [Confluence][1]. It makes for a good easy reference point.
However, in order for you runbooks to be available, meaning usable when needed,
there needs to an offline copy as well.

You will be ever thankful for that zipped up batch of markdown files that is
your runbook library when all things go down. I've been around when the system
housing the runbooks is down. Now what? You are working from memory. If you did
not write the runbooks then you are working from someone else's memory. If is
never a good time to verbally acknowledge you can do nothing until another piece
of software starts running again.

You know my recommendation is to start with a structured document source format.
Experience has shown that Yaml is best. Next, build them into markdown views and
take those artifacts and zip them up. Put them wherever you want but make sure
you get a copy for yourself. Emailing a zip file to yourself after a successful
build is the base level activity at this point. Heck, send it to a distribution
list and let the team share the wealth. Storing them in another accessible
location is also a good idea.

Your goal is to make the runbooks available when you need them. You will need
them. When you do other elements of your infrastructure will be failing as well.
In this business you cannot predict when that will happen or what will be
involved. Keep those runbooks close, local, and available.
